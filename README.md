# Fusion Boutique — Website Scaffold

This repository contains a professional, responsive website scaffold for a local fusion fashion boutique (traditional + modern clothing for men and women).

Local preview

1. Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click or use Live Server extension).
2. The site is static HTML/CSS/JS and requires no build step.

What's included

- `index.html`, `women.html`, `men.html`, `about.html`
- `css/styles.css` — responsive styles
- `js/script.js` — mobile nav, gallery filters, smooth scroll
- `PITCH.md` — business pitch to the boutique owner

Next steps

- Replace placeholder images with store photography (use `images/` folder).

Images

Add your store photos to the `images/` folder (see `images/README.md` for filenames). The site references files like `images/hero.jpg`, `images/silk-saree.jpg`, `images/store.jpg`.
- Add product pages or integrate with an e-commerce backend.
- Deploy to GitHub Pages or host on a simple static host.
